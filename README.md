# SHRDLU Game
A game based on the SHRDLU Game (a basic version, similar to the Hanoi Tower Problem) that uses Heuristics and Monte Carlo Algorithms to solve the game for you, or you can simply play the game manually.

## Running the program
Simply run the "main.cpp" file in the project. It features terminal based program where you can choose what type of gameplay you want.

## Features
This game features a stack storage system for the columns that you can place the blocks. It allows for either manual gameplay where you try to reach a goal, or you can select the random generator that attempts to complete the game. You can also set the board size as well as the goal states, whether there are multiple states, etc.

## Heuristics Solving Algorithm
This is the most sophisticated feature of the program, in which it runs a heuristic algorithm that repeats random patterns and chooses the highest chance of winning from the simulation as the next move. It repeats this until the game is solved.
